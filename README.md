[Reaper](https://reaper.fm) can generate *and* chase SMPTE MTC and LTC.

- Right click on the transport play button to configure chase options
- Insert a Timecode Object and edit it's `source properties` to generate timecode

I'm putting my projects here that illustrate this in action with best practices.
